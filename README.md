# Typing Speed Test 🧠⌨️

This is a simple project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their typing speed. The timer starts automatically when typing begins and stops when the entered text matches the original reference text exactly.


## 🚀 Features

- Auto-start timer when typing begins  
- Real-time spell check with color-coded feedback:
  - **Purple**: Correct so far  
  - **Orange**: Mistake detected  
  - **Green**: Perfect match, test complete  
- Reset button to restart the test  
- Millisecond-precision timer display

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## 📁 File Structure

/project-root
├── index.html # Main HTML structure
├── style.css # Styling rules
├── script.js # Timer logic and typing validation

## 📄 How It Works

1. The timer starts when the user begins typing.
2. The border of the text box changes based on accuracy:
   - **Purple** while text matches the beginning of the original
   - **Orange** if there's a mistake
   - **Green** once the text matches perfectly
3. Press **"Start Again"** to reset the test and timer.
